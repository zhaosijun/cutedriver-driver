    # == description
    # Closes application and optionally verifies that it is closed. A Hash argument can be used to set any of the optional parameters. Keys not set in the hash will use default values. Close can be set to force kill the application process if close fails. It can also be set to not check if the application process is terminated, in which case close is considered to be successful if the application is no longer in the foreground.\n
    # \n
    # [b]NOTE:[/b] this will currently always try to close applications, also privilegied applications. \n
    # \n
    # [b]For backwards compatibility:[/b] Instead of using a Hash as argument, the value can also be true, false or nil which will be taken as the value of :force_kill
